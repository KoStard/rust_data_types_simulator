# rust_data_types_simulator
Simulating data types in rust to learn how they work.
- Added signed integers with variable bites count, e.g. i7, i59... - Can see their bites to understand negative numbers.
- MinHeaps - getMini, insert, extract, delete_key - implemented min_heapify and min_heapify_up, implemented Display for MinHeap struct, so this is an output example for MinHeap from range (0..63).rev().
